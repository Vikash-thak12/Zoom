## Introduction 
A Zoom-like application built using modern web technologies to provide seamless video conferencing and audio communication. This project leverages the power of Next.js and TypeScript for robust and scalable development, GetStream for video and audio services, and Clerk for secure user authentication.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
